See... I'm slowly learning... Kind of. Day 1 homework was hard. But day 2 was somewhat easier? Minus the first excersise. I literally cant access Shakes and idk how to. 
Stackoverflow Chatgpt all seem to not know how to do it, or if they do, theyre doing it wrong. Im having a skill issue at figuring it out and im failing. But everything else is done right
The more i do this the easier its becoming to read javascript. The easier building these functions are becoming. Still a major change from Python, I WANT MORE FLASK INSTEAD OF JAVASCRIPT as of this writing.
